# Pago-Agil

Project made in 2017 for a databases related course (called "Data Management") of the "Information Systems Engineering" career at the National Technological University (Argentina). 

"Pago Agil" is roughly translated to "Quick Payment" in english

NOTE: This project was modified in 2019 to make the C# project better and more readable

Currently working to transform this into a .NET web app (C# + Blazor)
